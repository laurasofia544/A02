      <li>After installing the program, install git as a local program as well.</li>
      <li>Once you install git and launch webstorm, go into webstorm and connect your github account to webstorm.</li>
      <li>The go back to the github page and create a repository. Click the '+' at the upper right corner and choose "create new repository". This is where all your files will be stored.</li>
      <li>Once all of that is done you're now able to create your first project. Go to webstorm and create a new file, then add the file to git and commit your changes.</li>
      <li>After you've done the previous step, go into github and upload the file into your repository.</li>
